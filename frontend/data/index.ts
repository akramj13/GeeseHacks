      description: "A stock (also called a share) represents partial ownership in a company. When you purchase stock, you become a shareholder, meaning you own a fraction of that company. If the company performs well, its value increases, and the price of your stock might go up. However, if the company struggles or loses value, the price of your stock can decrease. Stocks are usually bought through brokers on stock exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), New Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) or NASDAQ.",

      description: "A bond is essentially a loan made by an investor to a company or government. The issuer (borrower) agrees to pay back the amount borrowed (the principal) at a later date, called the maturity date, along with periodic interest payments, known as coupons. Bonds are considered safer than stocks, but they offer lower returns. This is due to the fact that bonds are less volatile and their value is more predictable.",

The fund manager buys and sells investments like stocks or bonds on behalf of all the investors in the fund. When you invest in a mutual fund, you own shares of the fund, and the value of those shares goes up or down based on the performance of the investments inside the fund.",

      description: "A stock is a type of equity security, meaning it represents ownership in a corporation. As an investor, you might receive dividends, which are a share of the company’s profits distributed to stockholders.\n There are two main types of stocks: Common Stock: Gives shareholders voting rights at annual meetings and a claim to profits (through dividends). Preferred Stock: Does not usually offer voting rights, but preferred stockholders receive dividends before common stockholders and have a higher claim on assets in case of liquidation (if a company goes bankrupt the preferred stockholders are paid off prior to common stockholders). Stocks are generally categorized by market capitalization: Large-cap: Companies with a market value over $10 billion. Mid-cap: Companies with a market value between $2 billion and $10 billion. Small-cap: Companies with a market value under $2 billion."

      title: "Module 7: Understanding Bonds",
      description: "A bond is a debt security where the issuer borrows capital from bondholders in exchange for periodic interest payments and the return of the principal at maturity. Bonds come with various terms: Coupon Rate: The interest rate paid to bondholders, usually on an annual or semi-annual basis. Face Value: The principal amount that will be repaid at maturity, usually $1,000 per bond. Maturity Date: The date when the bond issuer must repay the principal. Yield: The return an investor can expect to earn from a bond. It can be calculated as current yield (annual coupon payment divided by the bond’s current price) or yield to maturity (YTM) (the total return if the bond is held until maturity). Bonds are categorized by the type of issuer: Government Bonds: Issued by national governments (e.g., Canada Savings Bond (CSB)). These are typically considered low-risk. Municipal Bonds: Issued by local governments, often offering tax-free interest income. Corporate Bonds: Issued by companies to raise capital. These can offer higher yields but come with higher risk. High-Yield (Junk) Bonds: Bonds issued by companies with lower credit ratings, offering higher yields due to the higher risk of default."

      description: "A mutual fund pools money from many investors to create a diversified portfolio of securities. Mutual funds are typically managed by professional fund managers who make investment decisions based on the fund’s objective (e.g., growth, income, balanced). Unlike ETFs, which are traded on exchanges, mutual funds are purchased and sold through the fund company at the Net Asset Value (NAV), which is calculated at the end of each trading day. There are two main types of mutual funds: Actively Managed Funds: Fund managers make decisions to try to outperform the market by actively buying and selling assets. Index Funds: These track a specific index and are passively managed, typically with lower fees."

      description: "An ETF is a pooled investment fund that holds a basket of assets, such as stocks, bonds, or commodities. It is listed and traded on exchanges, similar to individual stocks, allowing investors to buy and sell throughout the trading day. ETFs are typically designed to track specific indices, like the S&P 500, or specific sectors, industries, or commodities (e.g., energy, technology, gold). ETFs have lower expense ratios than mutual funds and provide liquidity since they can be traded at any time during market hours. Types of ETFs:  Index ETFs: Track the performance of a specific index (e.g., S&P 500 ETF). Sector ETFs: Focus on specific industries or sectors (e.g., Technology ETF). Bond ETFs: Track a portfolio of bonds, offering exposure to fixed-income securities. Commodity ETFs: Invest in physical commodities like gold, oil, or agricultural products."

      description: "A segregated fund is an investment fund similar to a mutual fund, but it comes with added protection because it’s offered through an insurance company. When you invest in a segregated fund, your money is pooled with other investors’ money and managed by professionals. What makes it different: Principal Protection: Segregated funds guarantee 75% to 100% of your initial investment at maturity (usually after 10 years) or upon the investor's death. If the market performs poorly, the insurance company will cover the difference to ensure your protected amount. Insurance Benefits: These funds include a death benefit, allowing investors to name beneficiaries. Upon death, the fund’s value is transferred directly to the beneficiaries, bypassing probate fees and maintaining privacy. Creditor Protection: In certain circumstances, segregated funds offer protection from creditors. This feature is particularly appealing to business owners or professionals seeking to safeguard their investments. Examples of Use Cases: A retiree invests in segregated funds to preserve capital and ensure their heirs avoid probate fees. A business owner uses segregated funds to protect personal assets from potential business liabilities. An investor looking for moderate growth opts for segregated funds with a reset feature to secure gains during favorable market conditions."

      description: "A stock is a tradable security representing a unit of ownership in a company, entitling the shareholder to residual claims on the company's assets and earnings. The value of stocks is influenced by various factors, including: Earnings Reports: Investors analyze earnings per share (EPS), revenue growth, and other metrics to assess company performance. Valuation Metrics: Investors use ratios like Price-to-Earnings (P/E), Price-to-Book (P/B), and Price-to-Sales (P/S) to determine stock value relative to company fundamentals. Dividends: Dividend yield measures how much a company pays in dividends each year relative to its stock price. Stock Volatility: Stocks can exhibit high volatility, where prices can fluctuate significantly in short periods, influenced by market trends, company news, and macroeconomic conditions. Market Sentiment: Market psychology, investor emotions, and news can have short-term effects on stock prices. Technical Analysis: Some investors use patterns and trends in stock prices (chart patterns, moving averages) to predict future price movements. Types of Stocks: Growth Stocks: Stocks from companies that are expected to grow at an above-average rate compared to other companies. Value Stocks: Stocks that are considered undervalued based on fundamental analysis, with low price-to-earnings ratios. Dividend Stocks: Companies that return a portion of their profits to shareholders in the form of dividends. Common Stock gives shareholders voting rights while Preferred Stock does not but Preferred Stockholders are ahead of Common Stockholders during a companies liquidation."

      title: "Module 12: Advanced Bond Analysis",
      description: "A bond is a fixed-income security with a contract that specifies the interest payments (coupon) and the principal repayment at maturity. The price of a bond fluctuates in the market and is inversely related to changes in interest rates. When interest rates rise, bond prices fall, and vice versa. Bonds are rated by agencies like Moody’s, S&P, and Fitch, which assign ratings (e.g., AAA for investment-grade bonds, BB for junk bonds) to reflect the likelihood of the issuer defaulting. Key bond features: Duration: Measures the sensitivity of a bond’s price to interest rate changes. Longer-duration bonds are more sensitive to interest rate changes. Credit Risk: The risk that the issuer may default on its obligations. Creditworthy issuers are less likely to default, so their bonds offer lower yields. Callable Bonds: Bonds that can be redeemed by the issuer before the maturity date. Convertible Bonds: Bonds that can be converted into a predetermined number of shares of the issuer’s stock. Sovereign vs. Corporate Risk: Sovereign bonds (issued by governments) are generally seen as safer than corporate bonds, but they can still be affected by country-specific risks such as political instability or changes in economic policies. Bond Laddering: A strategy where an investor holds bonds with different maturity dates to reduce interest rate risk."

      description: "A mutual fund is an investment vehicle that pools resources from multiple investors to invest in a diversified portfolio, managed by professionals or passively via index tracking. Mutual funds offer advantages like diversification, professional management, and liquidity. However, they also come with management fees, which can erode returns over time. The two main pricing types are: Open-End Funds: The fund issues new shares and redeems them at the NAV at the end of each day. Closed-End Funds: These have a fixed number of shares, and their price is determined by supply and demand on the open market. Additional features to consider: Expense Ratios: The annual fee for managing the fund, expressed as a percentage of the assets. Load vs. No-Load Funds: Load funds charge a sales commission, while no-load funds do not. Turnover: The rate at which the fund’s portfolio is bought and sold, affecting costs and tax efficiency.  Tax Efficiency: Actively managed funds may generate capital gains, which are taxable to the investor, while index funds generally have lower turnover and tax liability."

      description: "An ETF is a marketable security that pools assets to create a diversified portfolio of investments. ETFs can be classified based on: Active vs. Passive Management: Most ETFs are passively managed, tracking a specific index or sector, but actively managed ETFs are run by portfolio managers aiming to outperform the market. In-kind Redemption: This mechanism allows large institutional investors to exchange the underlying assets of an ETF for shares, reducing capital gains taxes. ETFs vs. Mutual Funds: Unlike mutual funds, ETFs do not have minimum investment requirements and can be traded intraday, giving them higher liquidity and flexibility. ETFs often have lower expense ratios but may come with brokerage fees. Leveraged and Inverse ETFs: These ETFs aim to amplify (or reverse) the returns of an underlying index by using derivatives, which can introduce higher risk but also higher potential rewards. Smart Beta ETFs: These ETFs track indexes based on factors like value, momentum, or volatility, aiming to outperform traditional market-cap weighted indices."
