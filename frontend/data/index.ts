      description: "A stock (also called a share) represents partial ownership in a company. When you purchase stock, you become a shareholder, meaning you own a fraction of that company. If the company performs well, its value increases, and the price of your stock might go up. However, if the company struggles or loses value, the price of your stock can decrease. Stocks are usually bought through brokers on stock exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), New Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) or NASDAQ.",

      description: "A bond is essentially a loan made by an investor to a company or government. The issuer (borrower) agrees to pay back the amount borrowed (the principal) at a later date, called the maturity date, along with periodic interest payments, known as coupons. Bonds are considered safer than stocks, but they offer lower returns. This is due to the fact that bonds are less volatile and their value is more predictable.",

When you invest in a mutual fund, you own shares of the fund, and the value of those shares goes up or down based on the performance of the investments inside the fund.",
